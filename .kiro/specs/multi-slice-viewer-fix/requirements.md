# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The multi-slice DICOM viewer in the radiology application requires comprehensive upgrades to provide state-of-the-art medical imaging visualization. Beyond fixing current display issues, this enhancement will deliver a professional-grade viewer with advanced features including AI-powered image enhancement, real-time collaboration tools, advanced measurement capabilities, and intelligent caching for optimal performance. This upgraded viewer will set new standards for medical imaging software and significantly improve diagnostic workflow efficiency.

2. WHEN using keyboard arrow keys THEN the viewer SHALL navigate between slices with immediate response
3. WHEN using the cine player controls THEN the viewer SHALL play through slices at the specified frame rate
4. WHEN reaching the first or last slice THEN the viewer SHALL provide clear visual feedback and prevent navigation beyond bounds
5. WHEN displaying slice information THEN the viewer SHALL show current slice number and total count accurately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a radiologist, I want image manipulation tools to work consistently so that I can adjust the display for optimal viewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adjusting zoom level THEN the image SHALL scale smoothly without pixelation or distortion
2. WHEN rotating the image THEN the transformation SHALL apply immediately and maintain image quality
3. WHEN adjusting brightness and contrast THEN the changes SHALL be visible in real-time
4. WHEN resetting view parameters THEN all transformations SHALL return to default values instantly
5. WHEN panning the image THEN the movement SHALL follow mouse/touch input precisely

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a radiologist, I want the viewer to handle different DICOM formats and edge cases gracefully so that I can view any valid medical imaging study.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading single-slice DICOM files THEN the viewer SHALL display the image without multi-slice controls
2. WHEN loading multi-frame DICOM files THEN the viewer SHALL extract and display all available slices
3. IF a DICOM file is corrupted or unreadable THEN the viewer SHALL show a descriptive error message
4. WHEN the backend processing fails THEN the viewer SHALL attempt fallback loading methods
5. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the viewer SHALL show loading progress and allow cancellation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a radiologist, I want consistent performance across different viewer modes so that I can choose the most appropriate visualization method for each study.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching to MultiFrame viewer THEN all slices SHALL load and display correctly
2. WHEN using the Comprehensive viewer THEN all tools and controls SHALL function properly
3. WHEN accessing the 3D viewer THEN volume rendering SHALL work with available image data
4. WHEN using the Optimized viewer THEN performance SHALL be noticeably improved for large datasets
5. WHEN viewer initialization fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to a working viewer mode

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a radiologist, I want AI-powered image enhancement and analysis tools so that I can detect abnormalities more accurately and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading a DICOM study THEN the viewer SHALL offer AI-powered image enhancement options (noise reduction, contrast optimization, edge enhancement)
2. WHEN AI enhancement is applied THEN the processing SHALL complete within 5 seconds and show before/after comparison
3. WHEN abnormalities are detected THEN the AI SHALL highlight potential areas of interest with confidence scores
4. WHEN using AI tools THEN the original image data SHALL remain unchanged and enhancement SHALL be reversible
5. WHEN AI processing fails THEN the viewer SHALL continue to function normally without AI features

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a radiologist, I want advanced measurement and annotation tools so that I can perform precise quantitative analysis of medical images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making measurements THEN the viewer SHALL provide tools for distance, area, angle, and volume calculations
2. WHEN creating annotations THEN the viewer SHALL support text labels, arrows, circles, and freehand drawing
3. WHEN measurements are made THEN the results SHALL be displayed in appropriate medical units (mm, cmÂ², degrees)
4. WHEN annotations are created THEN they SHALL persist across slice navigation and viewer mode changes
5. WHEN exporting measurements THEN the data SHALL be available in standard formats (DICOM SR, PDF, CSV)

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a radiologist, I want real-time collaboration features so that I can consult with colleagues and share findings instantly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sharing a study THEN other users SHALL be able to view the same images in real-time
2. WHEN making annotations during collaboration THEN all participants SHALL see changes immediately
3. WHEN using voice/video chat THEN the communication SHALL be integrated within the viewer interface
4. WHEN pointing to image areas THEN the cursor position SHALL be synchronized across all connected users
5. WHEN collaboration session ends THEN all annotations and measurements SHALL be saved automatically

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a radiologist, I want intelligent caching and prefetching so that I can navigate through large studies without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening a multi-slice study THEN the viewer SHALL preload adjacent slices in the background
2. WHEN navigating between slices THEN the display SHALL be instantaneous for cached images
3. WHEN memory usage reaches limits THEN the viewer SHALL intelligently purge least-used cached data
4. WHEN network connectivity is slow THEN the viewer SHALL prioritize loading of currently viewed slices
5. WHEN switching between studies THEN relevant cache data SHALL be preserved for quick return navigation

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a radiologist, I want advanced 3D visualization and reconstruction capabilities so that I can examine complex anatomical structures from multiple perspectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using 3D mode THEN the viewer SHALL provide volume rendering, maximum intensity projection (MIP), and surface rendering
2. WHEN manipulating 3D views THEN rotation, zoom, and clipping SHALL respond smoothly to user input
