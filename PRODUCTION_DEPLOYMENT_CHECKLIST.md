# Production Deployment Checklist

## Critical Pre-Deployment Fixes

### 1. Test Suite Stabilization (URGENT)
- [ ] Fix cache manager memory limit tests
- [ ] Resolve WebSocket timeout issues in collaboration tests
- [ ] Mock WebGL context properly for headless testing
- [ ] Fix state synchronization test mocking

### 2. Missing Core Components
- [ ] Complete Cine Player implementation (Task 2.3)
- [ ] Implement WebGL rendering fallbacks for non-WebGL environments
- [ ] Add real-time image adjustment controls
- [ ] Complete MPR viewer implementation

### 3. Configuration & Environment
- [ ] Set up production environment variables
- [ ] Configure WebSocket endpoints for production
- [ ] Validate service worker registration
- [ ] Set up CDN for static assets

### 4. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Enable production build optimizations
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (currently large due to medical imaging libraries)
- [ ] Set up proper caching headers

### 5. Security & Compliance
- [ ] Implement proper authentication middleware
- [ ] Add HIPAA compliance logging
- [ ] Set up secure WebSocket connections (WSS)
- [ ] Validate DICOM data sanitization

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Immediate)
1. Deploy with Simple and Multi-Frame viewers only
2. Disable advanced features (AI, Collaboration, 3D) temporarily
3. Focus on stable DICOM viewing and basic measurements

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Week 2)
1. Enable AI enhancement features
2. Activate real-time collaboration
3. Deploy 3D visualization capabilities

### Phase 3: Full Feature Set (Week 3)
1. Enable all advanced features
2. Full performance optimization
3. Complete monitoring and analytics

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Production Monitoring
- [ ] Set up application performance monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Configure error tracking and alerting
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints
- [ ] Set up log aggregation and analysis

### Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Database backup strategy
- [ ] DICOM file backup and archival
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Data retention policies

## Go-Live Readiness Score: 75%

**Recommendation:** Deploy Phase 1 (core functionality) immediately with advanced features disabled. Complete remaining tasks in subsequent phases.
