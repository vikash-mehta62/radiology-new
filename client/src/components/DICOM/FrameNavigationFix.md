# Frame Navigation Issue Analysis

## Root Problem:
1. **Batch 0 loads only frame 0** because `totalFrames = 1` initially
2. **Dynamic slice detection** updates `totalFrames = 96` AFTER batch loading
3. **Frame 1 navigation fails** because frame 1 was never loaded in batch 0

## Solution:
1. Wait for dynamic slice detection before loading batch 0
2. Ensure proper batch size calculation with correct totalFrames
3. Add better error handling for missing frames

## Console Evidence:
```
📦 [UnifiedViewer] Loading frames 0 to 0  ← PROBLEM: Only frame 0
🎯 [UnifiedViewer] Dynamic slice detection result: {detectedSlices: 96, ...}
🔄 [UnifiedViewer] Updating totalFrames from 1 to 96  ← Too late!
```

## Fix Applied:
- Enhanced batch loading with proper frame range validation
- Better navigation logic with frame availability checks
- Improved error handling and logging
